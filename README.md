# climatica

This package contains functions for working with climate data in R. 

These include functions to derive annual hydrological balance variables like climatic water deficit, and to derive bioclimatic variables.

Other utilities help to parse metadata on variable names, GCMs, emissions scenarios, timeframes and other factors commonly found in climate data file names, and to translate between abbreviations, units, and long names for these variables.
