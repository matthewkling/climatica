#' Calculate the 19 bioclimatic variables.
#'
#' This function calculates the 19 bioclimatic variables based on monthly precip
#' and monthly min and max temperatures. It is very similar to dismo::biovars
#' but differs in a couple key respects. First, it's much much faster. Second,
#' it only works on vectors, so to use it on rasters it should be paired with
#' raster::calc. Third, it works on time series in addition to normals, if fed
#' the right data. Fourth, Bio4 is not multiplied by 100 (dismo just does that
#' to save some resources). And finally, for Bios 8, 9, 18, and 19, if multiple
#' quarters have the same min or max value, this version computes the mean
#' rather than simply using the first one.
#'
#' @param x Numeric vector of length 36 or 42. If calculating biovars for a
#'   climate normal, should be 1 value per month for precip, tmax, and tmin,
#'   arranged p1:p12 tx1:tx12 tn1:tn12. If calculating for a time series, uses
#'   14 months per variable, with 13 and 14 being Jan-Feb of the next year. This
#'   is automtically determined based on the length of the input vector.
#' @return Numeric vector of length 19, representing the 19 bioclimatic variables
#'   in order.
